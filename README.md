# Zwoptex Coordinates

<a href="http://zwopple.com/zwoptex/">Zwoptex</a> comes packaged with a couple of very stable well tested coordinate formats. Sometimes game engines are using newer builds or arn't as mainstream. This repository is a collection of formats you can add through Zwoptex's preferences and use in your own documents.
